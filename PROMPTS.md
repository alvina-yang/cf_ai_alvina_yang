the node editor needs to be smarter about which fields to show. for LLM nodes, show prompt, 
model selector, and temperature. for HTTP nodes show URL, method, headers. make sure the model 
dropdown pulls from the config file so we can easily add new models later
```

```
nodes need visual feedback during execution. when a workflow is running, the active node should 
pulse yellow, completed ones show green border, failed ones show red. also preserve the 
nodeType when loading/saving workflows so we don't lose track of what type each node is
```

```
getting errors about 'Agent' not being found. looks like the agents package isn't the right fit 
here. can you refactor WorkflowAgent and LLMAgent to implement DurableObject directly instead? 
use state.storage.sql.exec for SQL operations and make sure the AI binding is properly typed
```

```
there's a lot of hardcoded URLs and model names scattered around. create a config.ts file that 
exports all the constants - worker URL, available models, default settings. then update 
components to import from config instead
```

```
getting 'any' types in a few places especially around the AI responses. the response structure 
from Workers AI can be either {response: string} or {text: string} depending on the model. 
handle both cases properly
```

```
write a clean README for this project. it's a visual workflow builder with AI agents on cloudflare. 
keep it short - just cover what it does, how to install it, and a quick example. add a small 
architecture diagram. make it look professional but not overly corporate
```
